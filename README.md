This is code for Sonic Pi (https://sonic-pi.net/).

Read me:

This is a long-form music piece composed for sculpted computer-randomness implemented through Sonic Pi.
There are several global characteristics that oversee a larger structure of the piece.
There are several distinct synthesizer modules, each with their own local characteristics.
Many of the characteristics change slowly over time by way of randomly-walking variables.
Other characteristics can change suddenly, but do so depending on global probabilistic settings.

The raw code for the piece is included in this respository.  You can copy and paste it into Sonic Pi, or save it and run it with the code

```
run_file "~NotR.rb"
```
